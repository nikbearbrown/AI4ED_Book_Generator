### Equation of the Model
The model described by the given statistics is a logistic regression model, commonly used for binary outcomes such as pass/fail scenarios. The equation for this model based on the provided coefficients can be expressed as:

\[ \text{logit}(P(\text{pass})) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{hours} \]

Where:
- \( \beta_0 \) (intercept) = -1.0
- \( \beta_1 \) (coefficient for hours) = 0.1

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \text{logit}(P(\text{pass})) = -1.0 + 0.1 \times \text{hours} \]

Where \( \text{logit}(P) \) is the log-odds of passing.

### Significance of Coefficients
1. **Hours Coefficient**:
   - **Value**: 0.1
   - **Standard Error**: 0.07
   - To determine if the coefficient for hours is statistically significant, you would typically look at the t-value (coefficient divided by standard error) or the corresponding p-value (not provided here). A rough estimate of the t-value is \( \frac{0.1}{0.07} \approx 1.43 \). Generally, a t-value greater than about 2 (for a 95% confidence level) indicates statistical significance, so this coefficient might not be significant.
   - **Interpretation**: Assuming it is significant despite the low t-value, for each additional hour of studying, the log-odds of passing increases by 0.1. This translates to higher odds of passing with more hours of studying.

2. **Intercept**:
   - **Value**: -1.0
   - **Standard Error**: 0.7
   - Similarly, for the intercept, \( \frac{-1.0}{0.7} \approx -1.43 \). The intercept is also likely not statistically significant based on this rough estimate.
   - **Interpretation**: The intercept in a logistic regression model represents the log-odds of passing when all independent variables are 0 (i.e., no hours studying). A value of -1.0 indicates negative log-odds of passing without studying, which suggests a lower probability of passing when no study hours are put in.

### Probability of Passing After Studying for 2 Hours
To find the probability of passing after studying for 2 hours:

\[ \text{logit}(P(\text{pass})) = -1.0 + 0.1 \times 2 = -0.8 \]

Convert log-odds to probability:

\[ P(\text{pass}) = \frac{e^{-0.8}}{1 + e^{-0.8}} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ P(\text{pass}) = \frac{e^{-0.8}}{1 + e^{-0.8}} \approx \frac{0.449}{1 + 0.449} \approx 0.310 \]

### Likelihood of Passing After No Hours Studying
For zero hours of studying:

\[ \text{logit}(P(\text{pass})) = -1.0 \]

Convert log-odds to probability:

\[ P(\text{pass}) = \frac{e^{-1.0}}{1 + e^{-1.0}} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ P(\text{pass}) = \frac{e^{-1.0}}{1 + e^{-1.0}} \approx \frac{0.368}{1 + 0.368} \approx 0.268 \]

Thus, with no study hours, the probability of passing is about 26.8%, and with two hours of study, it increases to about 31%. This analysis provides a basic understanding of the model, although exact significance levels and more precise interpretations would typically require additional statistical output such as p-values or confidence intervals.
